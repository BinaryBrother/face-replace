Physical installation built with a pre-existing art frame prototype. Viewers experience the work as a large
portrait mirror, and they see a face superimposed onto their own in real time. Viewers can take a snapshot 
of their own face which immediately becomes superimposed onto their own. As people view the mirror, subsequent 
people have their faces replaced by the previous viewers faces, enabling people to trade faces.

A physical knob enables viewers to scroll through saved faces.

Built with [OpenFrameworks](https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks) 
and [ofxFaceTracker](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxFaceTracker) and based on examples 
in [FaceSubstitution](https://github.com/arturoc/FaceSubstitution).
