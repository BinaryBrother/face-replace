Created over a period of 24 hours during [ArtHackDay "Lethal Software"](http://arthackday.net/gaffta/) and shown at 
[GAFFTA](http://gaffta.org) on December 15, 2012 by [Gabriel Dunne](https://github.com/quilime) and [Toby Shachman](https://github.com/electronicwhisper).

Physical installation built with an art-frame prototype, allowing viewers to experience the piece as a large
portrait mirror. A physical interface of a Griffin Power Knob allows a viewer to snapshot their own face, which 
immediately gets superimposed onto their own. Subsequent viewers have their face replaced by the previous viewer. 

By turning the knob left and right, viewers can view all other faces. Also included various public domain photos
of celebrities and cartoons.
